        I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer and an undergraduate student at Buddhi
        Dharma University, majoring in Informatics Engineering. My web
        development journey took off at Purwadhika, where I built a strong
        foundation in modern web technologies. I specialize in developing
        responsive and scalable web applications using front-end technologies
        like React and Next.js, alongside back-end technologies such as Node.js
        and Express.js.
